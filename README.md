# Contributor Guidelines

1. **ALWAYS** update your local develop branch before creating a new one.

2. To add a new feature, create a branch (branching from develop) with a name relevant/related to the feature.

3. Make sure that every file name is relevant to the contents of the file and follows react conventions.

4. Keep your code as clean as possible. Remove all unused imports. Remove all `console.log()` and other debugger codes.

5. Keep the number of installed packages minimal. Do not install a package if you don't need it. If you've installed a package in the past but you no longer need it, uninstall it.

6. Keep each commits as clear and concise as possible. Write every change that you did in that commit. Do not commit multiple irrelevant changes at once. If possible, use english. Don't spam your commit.

7. **NEVER** push directly to the main or develop branch.

8. If you think the changes are ready to be tested, create a pull request from your branch comparing to the develop branch and assign @dewodt as a reviewer.

9. Please explain all of your changes in that pull request and also make a demo video of that feature for all viewports.

10. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via WA/Line.
